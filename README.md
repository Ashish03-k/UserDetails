# userDetails
In this userDetails project I have created five endpoint that is API.
this are..
1) for saving user details in database.
2) for getting all users from database.
3) for getting those users whose ages is more than n number.
4) for getting users based on limit value.
5) retrieve single user based on his name.

And I tested all this api through postaman tool.
